%   Y = hpfilter(X, Fc, Fs) Filters the X signal with a 4th order 
%   Butterworth zero-lag filter (2 passes of a 2nd order). Returns the Y
%   filtered signal. Fc is the cut-off frequency and Fs the sampling
%   frequency of the original signal.
%
%   Y = hpfilter(X, Fc, Fs, TYPE) Filters the X signal with a 4th order 
%   Butterworth zero-lag filter (1 two-passes of a 2nd order) if TYPE is
%   'butter' and filters the X vector with a 20th order critically-damped
%   filter zero-lag too (5 two-passes of a second order) if TYPE is
%   'damped'. Returns the Y filtered signal. These calculations are in 
%   agreement with Robertson & Dowling recommendations [1].
%
%   Y = hpfilter(X, Fc, Fs, TYPE, N) Filters the X signal with a 2nd order
%   filter 'butter' or 'damped' with N passes. If the number of passes N is
%   impair for a simple filter and if it is pair for a zero-lag phase 
%   filter. Returns the Y filtered signal.
